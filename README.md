# Advent of Code 2022
Here we go again...
This is my testing system and (eventually) solutions for [AOC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). In an attempt to get better at Rust (I'm a little rusty ðŸ˜‰) I am doing this all in Rust.

## How to see my solutions
`cargo run <day>`

## How to use testing system
Each day gets a day##.rs file in the src directory. Each day must have the definitions shown in template.rs, an entry on line 5 of main.rs, and an entry in the `match` statement that begins on line 28.

## Dependencies 
 - [Rust Toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
 - Will to live (optional)

## Coming Soon (Maybe I'll actually do it this year)
Automatic input fetching and answer submittal right from the CLI!
